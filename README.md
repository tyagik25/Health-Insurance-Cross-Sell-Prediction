# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction

## Introduction:

#### Predicting Health Insurance Owners’ who will be interested in buying Vehicle Insurance”.
I have used the health insurance cross-sell prediction dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction?select=train.csv) Dataset.

I chose this dataset to understand how the cross-sell policy can be useful for the organization and how analytics can prove to be one of the essentials in doing this by analyzing the data and targeting the right people to buy the insurance policy.

## Analysis:

1. Used PySpark to load the big data. 
2. Implemented Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees Random Forest classifier.
3. Built a Neural Network Sequential Model using Keras to predict health insurance owners’ who will be interested in buying vehicle insurance
